## What is 3D Aerial Photograph

<img src="./media/3d_aerial_photo.svg" width="50%"></img>

> Since aerial photographs are taken at fixed intervals -- one every ten seconds from a survey plane -- approximately three-fourths of the geographical features are successive photographs in sequence, therefore, and takeing advantage of the resulting parallax, you can make the sense stand out in three dimensions.

*The Ark Sakura*, Kobo Abe, translated by Juliet Winters Carpenter


## How to get yourself to see 3D Aerial Photograph

> Continue to focus intently, making fine adjustments in the distance between the photos as needed, and at some point you will hit on just the right arrangement: then magically the low-elevation places will drop away, and the high-elevation ones com thrusting up at you.

*The Ark Sakura*, Kobo Abe, translated by Juliet Winters Carpenter

## What you will experience

> It goes beyond perspective; you would swear you were looking not at a photograph but at an exact replica of the scene. The impression of depth is in fact intensified so that in an urban area, the high-rise buildings and TV towers seem to jump up and threaten to stab you: in a mountain area it's the crags and treetops on the peaks. In the beginning, I would always find myself ducking or closing my eyes.
